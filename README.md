Task 1 - Data Cleaning 🧽
Task Summary
This task focused on cleaning a messy dataset to prepare it for analysis. I used Python (Pandas) for the data cleaning process.

Dataset
Name: Medical Appointment No Shows

File: KaggleV2-May-2016.csv

Cleaning Steps Performed
✅ Renamed columns to lowercase with underscores (e.g., ScheduledDay ➡ scheduled_day)

✅ Fixed column name typo: handcap ➡ handicap

✅ Converted scheduled_day and appointment_day columns to proper datetime format

✅ Standardized values in gender and no_show columns to be all uppercase

✅ Converted patientid to integer type

✅ Checked for duplicate rows (none found)

✅ Verified missing values (none found)

Output
The cleaned dataset is saved as:
📁 task1.csv

What I Learned
How to clean real-world datasets using Pandas

The importance of consistent formatting, accurate data types, and standardized values before performing analysis.
